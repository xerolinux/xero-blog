### Backstory

Before I begin, I would like to clarify that, when I say **Linux** in this context I mean **Desktop Linux**.

When I started this whole **Linux** endeavor, I did not have money in mind. It all started back in 2020/2021, when I fell in love with [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org]) while using the now infamous [**Manjaro**](https://manjaro.org) Distrobution. Yes, this is when I got hooked to **Linux**. Now don't get me wrong, I have since tried many DEs and WMs. But alas only **KDE Plasma** answered my needs.

Since then I started getting the urge to build my own *Distro* my way. With everything I wanted out the box. At first it was hard, real hard. I could find an easy way to do it. That's until I stumbled upon a project we all know and love called [**ArcoLinux**](https://arcolinux.info). Yep, they are all about learning and becoming self-reliant. Especially that it was based on my favorite builder Distro [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org).

### XeroLinux Distro

Once I learned enough to start working on my very own Distro that I have named **XeroLinux** which is made of 2 words, **Xero**, pronounced like (Ksero), which is **Greek** for "I Know" or "I Understand" and **Linux**, combined it means *"I know/understand Linux"*. Clever eh ? With name in hand, the first *functional* ISO was built in April of 2021. Even though I was happy with it, it had way too much in the way, a bit too bloated both visually and functionally. It still needed a ton of work, making it lighter, and not too overwhelming.

Anyway, as I kept working on it, and showed it around, I was asked why not make it public and share it with the world ? At first I hesitated, but then I was like, why not ? I like being sorta famous lol. And the rest is history, as they say...

### Fundraising

Now we get to the meat & potatoes of this post, why ask for money when it's **F.O.S.S** ? Well in case you did not know, the *Free* in *Free Open Source* does **NOT** mean free of charcge, instead it means Freedom to fork and do with what you want. So us Developers have all the right in the word to charge for our time. Read that again, charge for our **TIME**.

Many of us are just contributers, constantly giving without asking for anything in return. Which means no R.O.I (return on time invested). Some, not many of us with *real* daily jobs can do that for a long time, with the rest of us without any, or having difficulties I.R.L, use the knowledge and creations as a sole means of survival.

Now, I do agree with you when you say, we shouldn't force you to pay. That's why we use the *Fundraising* or *Donation* methods. While we do not force you to pay, it would be great if you did. Would help both of us. You get a useful product while we are able to survive to give you more. A so called Win-Win scenario. So if you fell like helping me out financially, you can do so via the **Donate** button in the menu up top/side. Not forced to, but would be appreciated ;)

### Why I *Killed* the Distro

I did not *kill** it. The code is still here. I am still maintaining it behind-the-scenes, hoping to one day bring it back, given the right amount of interest/funding. Right now I am instead working on the [**XeroLinux Toolkit**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli) and other projects, contributing to **ArchLinux** my favorite distro where I can, learning as I go. Also I am doing my best to help **KDE Plasma** fix issues as I find them, talking to the various devs.

Oh not to forget about my [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux). So I am always busy lol.

### Hate in F.O.S.S

I see a lot of Devs out there, including myself receiving hate, for that reason. Simply because of the misinterpretation of the word *Free* in *Free Open Source*. That should stop. We need a more collaborative community. There are tons of friendly ones out there, but equally there are plenty who build projects for the sake of showing off how much they *despise* others. Now am not going to name any names here, but the longer this goes on, the slower **Linux** will grow.

So if you love **Linux** as much as you say you do, please help your favorite projects grow in any way shape or form. You can do that by either *Donating* for financial support if you are not a developer and do not know how to code, or by simply *Reporting Issues* upstream helping them get better. Complaining for the sake of it, or hating will go nowhere.

Anyways, thanks for reading this. If you want to discuss the matter, you can *Toot* me on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) or by joining me on my [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu).

See ya there ;)
