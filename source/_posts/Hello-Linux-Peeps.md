Welcome to my bolg ! This is where I will be posting my thoughts and ideas for future projects that will eventually be put under the [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz) umbrella. This is just a welcome post. Nothing to see here. Just keep an eye out for future ones of which there will be _many_.

I will be sharing every single post on my [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux), so if you follow me there, you will see them. If not than what are you waiting for ? **DO IT** lol. Anyway, I hope you like this new approach :D

I really hope you like what am doing here. It's all in the spirit of sharing. I love **Linux** and everything it brings with it, the freedom, the community (when it's positive). So let's do this...
