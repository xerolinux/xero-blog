### What was/is XeroLinux

Well, in case you were living under a rock for the past 3 or more years, **XeroLinux** was and still is an Arch-Based Distrobution with a riced **KDE Plasma** which is inteanded to make installation simpler by using the **Calamares** installer, that's it. It's no more no less than that.

It was never built with any *specific* goal in mind beyond that. You still need to be armed with *some* **Linux** knowledge to get yourselves out of a tight spot if and when it happens. Limited to no support was being provided simply because I can't do any better than what the **ArchWiki** does and I do not own a variety of configs to test on.

In short all this distro provides is an easy way to get up and running with the [**XeroLinux Toolkit**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli) included (Xero icon on the dock) to help you with initial setup if need be.

### Potential Return.

I have been thinking about its fate. Should I or shouldn't I bring it back ? I am tryiong to gather information on whether interest is still there with the following [**Fundraiser**](https://ko-fi.com/Post/Some-Great-News-Coming-L4L8XLJBN). But if you can't support me financially, I came up with another idea which I will share with you here via a Poll.

First let me tell you about it. What I am thinking is, since one could achieve the same result as the distro itself by using both the **ArchInstall** in combination with my **PlasmaInstall** scripts for you advanced users out there, with the distro doing the same thing just in a simpler way for the beginners not wanting to bother with the TTY way, why not offer it as a bonus for those of you who *can* Donate. In case you can't and still want to enjoy my work for free, you can use my scripts which will *never* be paywalled.

Bref, that's a long way of saying, by donating, you will get the ISO that has all the essentials done for you, like ricing, basic packages, and **KDE Plasma** pre-configured for you out the box, or my scripts available for free, which require the use of **ArchInstall**. Let me know by voting below.

I am just trying to make money to survive, any way I can, in this case, by using the only tools I have at hand, my **Linux** knowledge, until I figure out a *real* job. So I do apologize if am boring you with this.

Please vote in the poll below so I know what to do. Will expire in a week so get voting. Thanks a ton for doing so. Will check on results on a daily basis. Also whatver the results are it's Ok with me. Don't worry about it. I will continue bringing you the best I can as I learn ;)
