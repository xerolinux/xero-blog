## Information...

As you know by now, I have been working on my **ArchLinux** Post-Install toolkit found [**here**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli). I now added a feature where it will prompt you about your **GPU** setup where you are expected to know that information answering correctly.

## Maybe Not ?

It was brought to my attention, however, that I should not expect too much. Thus I am coming to you with this question. How should I go by showing user the releveant information about their GPU setup ? Should I use `inxi -G` or use the `lspci | grep GPU VendorID` ?

To make things easier to read, I am inclined to use the former. What do you think ? Your input is highly appreciated. So let me know either on my [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu) or [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux). Thanks.

## Toolkit Growth

Also if you any ideas as to what else can be included in said toolkit, please share. Would help make it the defacto **Post-Install** tool to use for anyone considering the jump to **ArchLinux**...

Thanks for reading and sharing..
