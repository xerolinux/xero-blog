### You Have a YouTube Channel ?

Lol, yeah I know, it such a small one almost no one knows about it. What I first started it, I thought so many people making tons of money, why shouldn't I ? Well, it took me so long to get monetization abilites, and when I did I was like, **Nice!**.

But as time went by it became more and more difficult to come up with new ideas to keep it interesting. So I gave up for a while. Then, after 6 to 8 months I came back, rest is history.

### What now Xero ?

Hehe, I do not know to be perfectly honest. Am not getting enough views, and my Live Streams are only getting 6 to 8 participants. Also the ideas, quality, and equipment not being available to continue. There's also the fact that there's no point of monetizing my content since **YouTube** and my Bank, the only one I can use are not talking to each other, without any way for me to fix that. All these issues piling up.

So, in the next few days or weeks, I will be killing ads on all my videos, making your viewing experience a much better one with 0 ads to skip through.

### What's the Catch ?

This comes with a caveat, since I won't be making any money there, due to the mentioned issue, I will instead have not choice but to rely on the [**XeroLinux Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/XeroLinux) fundraiser for the forseeable future.

Why there ? Err, coz that's the only service that has no issues with my bank. Simple as that. I hope you understand my situation here. As I mentioned on a previous post, you are not obligated to *donate*, however would be highly appreciated if you do.

### What's the plan moving foreward ?

When it comes to plans for the channel from this point on, simple, I will be using it as a tool. What I mean by that is, I will be publishing videos only when I feel the situation needs it, for example if I feel a guide I want to put out cannot be done in writing. Or when I need to show off a tool/script am working on. You get the idea.

As to what day videos will be published, I will do it on a **Wednesday** whenever there is one. Also, do not worry about monthly Live Streams, they are here to stay. And when I get the chance, maybe bring back the [**XeroTalk**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeTlEEB2MZX6iUQWtkOCCcAm-edlLVCf4) seriles, where I sit down with various personalities in the **Linux** sphere and talk about various topics. Who knows.

Bottom line is, my channel is nothing but a tool, not a way to monetize anymore. I hope I don't lose you as a subscriber because of this. However, it's fine if you feel the need to leave, no harm no foul.

Anyways, thanks again for reading this. If you want to discuss the matter, you can *Toot* me on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) or by joining me on my [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu).
