## I am out of ideas...

As title says, I am fresh out of ideas for the moment. I need to "Borrow" your brains for a bit lol.. Maybe a tool/toolkit in GUI or CLI form, that might be useful. Of course we are talking **ArchLinux** here. I currently know **Bash** and a bit of **YAD** (Bash GUI). I do have one idea though...

## Xero's ArchKDE Installer

it has been boiling in my brain for a while now, a fork of the [**ArchInstall**](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/) script that only has the [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org) profile and would instead offer the 4 methods I have in my [**PlasmaInstall**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-plasma) script, have the **multilib** repo enabled by default and ability to set parallel downloads not hidden under `--advanced` flag, among other tweaks.

If you can help me with that I would forever be thankful, simply coz I do not know **Python** yet, still trying to wrap my head around **Bash**. What do you think ? Please do let me know via [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux), thanks ;)
