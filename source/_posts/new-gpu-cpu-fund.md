#### What's this ?

I’ve been thinking my PC could really use an upgrade. Take a look at the specs attached below, and you’ll see how ancient it is. I’m not looking to build a whole new rig, but I definitely need to swap out a few key parts like the **CPU** and **GPU**. With the **XeroLinux** Distro not coming back anytime soon, it’s crucial to put funds towards these upgrades where they truly matter.

#### What CPU ?

Well, I’m not looking for much. For the CPU, I’m considering an upgrade to either the [**Ryzen 7 5800X3D**](https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d-socket-am4) valued at $330 or the [**Ryzen 9 5950X**](https://global.microless.com/product/amd-ryzen-9-5950x-16-core-3-4-ghz-socket-am4-105w-desktop-processor-100-100000059wof/) valued at $452. Honestly, it doesn’t matter which one—I just need that extra boost for compiling stuff.

#### What GPU ?

That’s where things get a bit tricky. I’m still undecided between sticking with **nVidia** or switching to **AMD**. I am currently torn between the two. Now, I know most of you would recommend **AMD** because it’s hassle-free on **Linux**—and you’d be right. But as a content creator who relies on [**Cuda**](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) and **nVidia**'s [**nVenc Encoder**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide/), I’m leaning towards sticking with nVidia.

However, if I do decide to switch to Team Red, I’d go for the [**RX 6950XT**](https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-radeon-rx-6950xt-16gb) currently valued at $400 here. Otherwise, if I stay with Team-Green, it’s going to be the [**RTX 3090**](https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/rtx-3090-msi-suprim-x-24gb) valued at $595.

#### Conclusion

Upgrading the **GPU** is my top priority right now, as it will make the most significant impact. My current **GTX 1080** is nearing its end-of-life, and I can manage with my **Ryzen 5 3600X** for a bit longer. So, if you can help me raise enough funds to upgrade the **GPU** and stay ahead in the **Linux** world, I’d be incredibly grateful. If we can raise enough for both upgrades, it would be a huge boost to my setup and productivity.

Every little bit helps, and if each of you who appreciates my work chips in just a few bucks, we’ll reach the goal in no time.
